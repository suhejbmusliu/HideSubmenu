🧭 Strapi Navigation Menu (React + Vite)

This project is a React-based responsive navigation system inspired by the Strapi.io website.
It demonstrates how to build an interactive menu with context, submenus, and sidebars using React Hooks and reusable components.

🚀 Features

🧱 Modular Components — built with Navbar, Sidebar, NavLinks, Submenu, and Hero.

⚙️ Global State Management — handled through a custom React Context.

📱 Responsive Sidebar — opens and closes with smooth transitions.

🧭 Dynamic Submenu — displays nested links when hovering over menu items.

🧠 Mouse Events Logic — uses onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave, and useRef() for precise hover detection.

🎨 Clean UI structure — easily styled with custom CSS.

🧩 What I Practiced

While building this project, I practiced and learned:

React Context API – managing global states (openSidebar, closeSidebar, setPageId, etc.).

Component Composition – splitting logic into small, reusable parts (Navbar, NavLinks, Submenu, Sidebar, Hero).

Event Handling – controlling when submenus appear or disappear based on mouse position.

Conditional Rendering – showing/hiding UI elements using simple conditions and dynamic classNames.

Array Mapping – dynamically rendering data from an external data.js file.

Working with Refs – using useRef and getBoundingClientRect() for hover area detection.

Responsive Design Concepts – ensuring the sidebar and main navigation adapt to smaller screens.

Using React Icons – importing and rendering icons like FaBars and FaTimes.
